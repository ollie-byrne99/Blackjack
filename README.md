## Aim of the game

- The aim of the game is to attain a higher total of points than the dealer, without exceeding 21 points. 

- If you exceed 21 point you go bust, and thus lose the game.

- You play the game each round by choosing whether or not to accept a randomly dealt card. 

- These cards are assinged points ranging from 1 to 10. 

- You begin with two randomly dealt cards, which sets your initial points tally.

- You either take a new card to increase you tally, or hold your current points total, assuming that it is high enough to beat the dealer.

- Input 'hit' to take a new card, 'stay' retains your total.

- To start this game, input 'node index.js' in the command line in this directory.
